# MovieSelector ðŸŽ¥

## Description ðŸ“š
So you are probably wondering "why in hell would anyone make such a stupid and simple tool" ahhh my friend i have just the answer you seek. 

I made this random movie selector for a simple reason.. When my girlfriend is over at my house, she never knows what to watch. She always wants to watch something, but never has any clue what that would be. SO NOW i present to you.. THE RANDOM MOVIE SELECTOR. This tool will allow me to select a random movie and watch it on multiple different servers! My friends who suffer from the same chaos. I suggest using this tool for peace and serenity
